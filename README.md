# Operative-Sistems
Main repository where all the practices will gonna stay

The structure of this repo, it's this, each practice gona have a branch where the code will be, just to avoid having a lot of repos with smalls chuncks of code for each practice.
Right now this is the directory:
- Practice 1: Simulation of batch execution
- Practice 2: Simulation of multiprograming execution (using keyboard events)
- Practice 3: Simulation of the algorithm of FCFS and the diagram of five states (usign keyboard events, and managment using just 5 process on memory (virtualy))
- Pracice 4: Simulation of the algorithm of FCFS (continuation with a few things addded)
- Practice 5: Similation of the algorithm of RoundRobin (We change the main algorithm so have the funtionality)
- Practice 6: This is a break for the creation of the main system. In this practice we recreate the problem about Producer-consumer using Threads to solve the problem.
